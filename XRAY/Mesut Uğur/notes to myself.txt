Insulation of windings has not yet been considered, however the fill factor is below 0.2, so there is plenty of space right now.
Leakage inductance calculation has not been established.
Magnetizing inductance calculation has not been established.
Voltage regulation should be considered as the resistance of the secondary winding is high.
Proximity effect has not been considered.
